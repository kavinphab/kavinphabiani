                <p className='flex justify-center'>My name is Kavin Phabiani and I am a computer science student at the University of California - Riverside. I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, C++, and JavaScript, as well as developer tools like Git, Github, and VS Code. I have also gained experience working with technologies like NextJS, Tailwind, and QT Creator, as well as data visualization tools like Tableau. I have interned at Monet Analytics, where I increased the accuracy of a TikTok audience response score to 87% through the use of multivariate algorithms and data analysis techniques. I have also interned at Healthy Acres, where I consolidated and analyzed import data on various forms of Moringa and identified opportunities for the company to expand its business. In addition, I have worked as a front-end developer for Carla's Writing Space, where I performed search engine optimization and developed a website using Squarespace and custom CSS. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a developer and data analyst and am open to new opportunities to utilize my skills and make a difference. Feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or email to connect and learn more about my work.</p>
